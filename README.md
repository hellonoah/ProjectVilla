# ProjectVilla
Project Brief for VIP villa rental company

A high end luxury villa rental company based in the rugged hillsides of central Andalucia, Spain, are looking for a new website to be built. First up they want to get a homepage designed which can be used to set a theme and style guide to influence the rest of the site. The homepage needs to include a custom search bar, 2-3 featured properties, a quick call to action contact form, and a simple-to-use fully responsive un-intrusive navigation bar. Theyâ€™re looking for the site design to portray luxury and simplicity, all with a subtle, super clean design.
